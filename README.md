Small Python programs to practice conditional statements and decision-making logic."
**Conditional Statements & Loops**
This repository contains a collection of small, beginner-friendly Python programs that demonstrate the use of conditional statements (if, elif, and else) and loops (for and while) to control the flow of a program.
Practice to strengthen their control flow, iteration, and logical thinking skills in Python.
